Game Map (Chris Klassen):
=========================

The game map work involves all generation, enemy placement, tiling and structures.

The game map is generated completely dynamically, based on the size of the map passed into the constructor and defines for the size of logical blocks in-game.

This dynamic generation involves complicated zoning, division of the map into small segments, and assigning objects to various parts of the game.

The object assignment requires the use of an Enemy Hierarchy, which loads a file with a specialized format, interprets it, and constructs a tree that can be traversed by the programmer in various ways to create unique groups of enemies that are random and often times unpredictable.


Deity (Julian Brandrick):
=========================

Worked on with Alex Lam and Calvin Rempel.

The Deity work involved ability casting, sending and receiving ability events, displaying a graphic upon ability cast 
    and removing entities upon death or cooldown.

When an ability is cast everyone has to know about it. The client doing the attacking sends a message to the server, 
    which then sends a skill event to the client that was hit and a skill notification to all other clients. A skill
    event tells the affected client how it was affected, what value to change and how much to change it by. A skill
    notification tells all other clients where the affect took place and what type it was.

Each ability type has a different graphic, a different cooldown and its own onClick. When the onClick is called, it
    loads its graphic, casts its ability within a radius and removes the graphic after its duration. After the
    cooldown, the ability can be used again.

UI and GameScene (Chris Klassen):
=================================

The UI work done involved aligning elements properly for the 300% zoom on each scene, as well as adding moving elements to the lobby for polish.

The GameScene work involved setting up the playable scene for users to interact with.
