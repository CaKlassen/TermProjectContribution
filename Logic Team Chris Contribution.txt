Game Map (Chris Klassen):
=========================

The game map work involves all generation, enemy placement, tiling and structures.

The game map is generated completely dynamically, based on the size of the map passed into the constructor and defines for the size of logical blocks in-game.

This dynamic generation involves complicated zoning, division of the map into small segments, and assigning objects to various parts of the game.

The object assignment requires the use of an Enemy Hierarchy, which loads a file with a specialized format, interprets it, and constructs a tree that can be traversed by the programmer in various ways to create unique groups of enemies that are random and often times unpredictable.


Deity (Julian Brandrick):

UI and GameScene (Chris Klassen):
=================================

The UI work done involved aligning elements properly for the 300% zoom on each scene, as well as adding moving elements to the lobby for polish.

The GameScene work involved setting up the playable scene for users to interact with.
